# react_sandbox
Notes and workshop for learning ReactJS application development

The goal here is to investigate technologies to build useful applications for customers to interact with our product. 


# Getting Started

We need to do some reading and then some installing software to follow along the examples

* [An example multi platform application](https://medium.com/@benoitvallon/a-mobile-desktop-and-website-app-with-the-same-code-dc84ef7677ee)
* [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
* [Setting up the development environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

* [Vistual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - I recommend using this as the text editor for doing development.
